        <p><span class="story-txt">Fresh ingredients, made from scratch. An open kitchen, marinated and grilled meats. And a friendly environment are the cornerstones of our success</span>
            <br><br><span class="story-sub-txt">Our story begins back in 2011, when the high street eateries traditionally sold tasteless food, in often depressing miserable surroundings. It was back then that a couple of restless and unsatisfied dudes made it their mission to find decent grub. They traveled far and wide yet at the end of another long day still asking the same question; “where can I get a decent burger round here!?”.  They returned home and decided enough was enough, their hunger and tiredness was put to a side. That was the night Grubs-Up was born! They envisaged a place where burgers looked appetising, made from fresh quality ingredients and tasted simply phenomenal. Where the people who served you actually loved what they do and they did all this in surroundings that actually made you happy and smile.</span></p>
